### Project 1 : finding the Higgs Boson

This project is about solving a binary classification problem. Given input data and a vector and the corresponding collision events, the goal is to determine a model that can predict the best output for new data.

### Project 2: Road Segmentation

This project is about solving a binary classification problem. Given an image, we have to determine if every patch of 16x16 pixels in this image is either a road or not {1 or 0}.
